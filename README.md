# portifolio
This is my portifolio project where i have created gorgeous portifolio site to showcase the great projects that i have built. This portifolio site will contain a modern landing page, an about page where I have chance to share my contact info and talk a little bit about myself, and a series of project pages to show of and detail all the projects that i have built.
